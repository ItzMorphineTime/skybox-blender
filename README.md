# Skybox Sphere Generator for Blender

This Python codebase contains a set of Blender Python scripts to create a perfectly UV-mapped skybox sphere, apply an RGB texture and a displacement map provided by the BlockadeLabs API (https://www.blockadelabs.com/). The main goal of this project is to allow users to have easy controls over the displacement and topology of the sphere mesh using a grayscale depth texture generated by BlockadeLabs AI.

The project can be combined with the [Skybox Gallery](https://github.com/ItzMorphineTime/skybox-gallery) repository, which helps users create a curated library of high-quality skybox textures and depth textures for use in 3D applications at runtime.

## Features

- Create a UV-mapped sphere with adjustable topology
- Apply an RGB texture and displacement map from BlockadeLabs API
- Customize the displacement and appearance of the sphere using a grayscale depth texture
- Combine with the Skybox Gallery repository for a curated library of textures

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Blender installed on your system
2. Open Blender and import the Python scripts into Blender's text editor
3. Run the scripts to generate the skybox sphere and apply the texture and displacement map
4. Customize the sphere's appearance and displacement using the provided GUI widget

## Files

- `CreateSkybox.py`: Main script to create the skybox sphere, apply the RGB texture, and the displacement map
- `CreateSkybox_GUI_Widget.py`: Custom GUI widget to allow users to modify the base color texture, depth texture, and displacement strength
- `ApplyLinearGradients.py`: Script to apply linear gradients to the depth texture for better control over displacement

## Potential Improvements and Next Steps

1. Add support for different skybox shapes (e.g. cube or cylinder) to increase flexibility for different use cases
2. Implement a feature to batch process multiple textures and depth maps, allowing users to create a library of skyboxes more efficiently
3. Optimize the sphere generation process to improve performance when working with high-resolution textures and large numbers of segments and rings
4. Integrate the skybox generation process directly into the [Skybox Gallery](https://github.com/ItzMorphineTime/skybox-gallery) repository, creating a more streamlined workflow for users
5. Provide additional GUI controls for more advanced customization, such as modifying the UV mapping or adjusting the blend mode of the texture layers
